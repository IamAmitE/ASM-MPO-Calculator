# ASM MPO Calculator

The ASM MPO tool is designed to assist decision-making regarding compound development and repurposing for treating seizures. The tool scores candidate molecules that are aimed to cross the epileptogenic blood-brain barrier for exerting their therapeutic effects. It is not aimed to be used for other CNS diseases. We recommend using this tool as an aid to other risk-estimation methods.
The calculator does not contain components that could harm your computer. It will be downloaded to the Download folder and not to program files. To enable its use, you may have to manually choose to allow its download.
